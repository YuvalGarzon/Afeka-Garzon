              The Maldives is a tropical island nation in the Indian Ocean, famous for
              its clear blue water, white sand beaches, and overwater villas. It is
              made up of many small islands and coral reefs that create a peaceful and
              relaxing atmosphere.

              I chose the Maldives because it represents the perfect quiet escape:
              beautiful views, warm weather, and calm ocean all around. It is an ideal
              place for snorkeling, swimming, and enjoying nature, far from busy city
              life.
