              Thailand is a beautiful country in Southeast Asia, famous for its
              tropical islands, golden temples, and street food. Cities like
              Bangkok and Chiang Mai, together with beaches like Phuket and
              Krabi, create a mix of culture, nature, and nightlife.

              I chose Thailand because it offers everything in one trip: amazing
              food, friendly people, rich history, and incredible views. It is a
              place where you can relax on the beach, explore markets, and
              discover a different culture.
