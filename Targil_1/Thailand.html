        Thailand is a beautiful country in Southeast Asia, famous for its
        tropical islands, golden temples, and street food. Cities like Bangkok
        and Chiang Mai, together with beaches like Phuket and Krabi, create a
        mix of culture, nature, and nightlife.

        I chose Thailand because it offers everything in one trip: amazing food,
        friendly people, rich history, and incredible views. It is a place where
        you can relax on the beach, explore markets, and discover a different
        culture.
